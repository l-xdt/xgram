# XGram

**Context:** xSocial is a combination of Facebook and Instageam: turned into one clone.

XGram is now the Instagram clone, alone. Based of 2017-2021 Instagram due to outdated tutorial. This repository is for the both of us; It's a backup for me just in-case my hard-drive fails.

And for you, you can still follow this code espcially if you want to experiment with Tailwind CSS, and SVGs.

**Written in Plain HTML, and Tailwind CSS.. there is nothing to explore - very surface-level project**

## Run Locally

Clone the projet and run it on XAMPP

(**PS:** I would recommend still, an alternative domain from localhost, to add to the reality aspect.)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/l-xdt/xgram
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd xgram
```

Install XAMPP (via Chocalatey, if you don't have it.)

```bash
  chocalatey install xampp
```

Start the server

```bash
    [Directory]/[ServerName]/apache-start.bat
```

**PS:** If you trust your web skills, here is a manual on how to self-host a domain: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Song)

## Roadmap

- Additional browser support

- Change what you see on your feed.

- Add as many posts as your want to your profile.

- Change your profile name.

- Supported on phone, kind of.

- This is all writted by hand: with only **Vanilla** HTML and Tailwind CSS.

- The FavIcon is influenced by the signature: **X**

## FAQ

Now, FAQ..

#### Can I change this in any-way I would like?

Yes, do as you please with this, because it is made for you, community-first even if I am targeting a very small niche with this GitHub Repository.

#### Can I host this, If I can how?

You can, using XAMPP. The one that I have gone into detail many times. A short summary is localhost works by using the IP every computer running Windows and Linux (and some macOS computers) use: 127.0.0.1

So, use whatever you want to host, but I recommend XAMPP. If you need help getting started with it click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff) ~ To start you off.
